    "promptModifier": "In this chapter, we dissect the heart of a text. The objective is to accurately identify the main idea of a passage and locate the topic sentence within each paragraph.

    "promptModifier": "A text, like a building, has an architecture. This session is dedicated to recognizing common patterns of organization: chronological order, cause and effect, comparison and contrast, problem and solution, and classification. By identifying the author's chosen structure, you can better follow their logic and anticipate the flow of information. We will use graphic organizers to map out these patterns from selected texts."
