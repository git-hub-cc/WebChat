[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README-cn.md)

A feature-rich, modern web chat application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and Java Spring Boot for the backend. It utilizes WebRTC for direct user-to-user media communication, supporting text, file sharing, voice messages, and real-time audio/video/screen-sharing calls. Initial user discovery and connection negotiation are handled by a WebSocket-based signaling server (implemented in Java Spring Boot). WebRTC communication minimizes reliance on a central server for heavy media data transfer (except for signaling and optional TURN relay services), while AI chat and TTS functionalities interact with external services via a backend proxy. The application deeply integrates themed AI assistant contacts with Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. AI characters possess dynamic context (like daily random events and moods) and support intelligent summarization for long conversations, delivering a more vivid interactive experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
*   **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux (for AI interfaces), Spring WebSocket, Maven
*   **Core Communication Technology:** WebRTC (RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel, MediaStream API)
*   **Signaling:** WebSockets
*   **NAT Traversal:** STUN/TURN (Coturn recommended)
*   **Local Storage:** IndexedDB (Frontend)
*   **External Service APIs (via Backend Proxy):**
    *   OpenAI-compatible API for AI chat completions.
    *   TTS API (e.g., GSV AI Lab or other compatible services) for text-to-speech.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Initialization:** When a user opens the application, a unique user ID is generated or loaded from local storage.
2.  **Signaling:** The client connects to a WebSocket-based signaling server (provided by the Spring Boot application). This server helps users discover each other and exchange messages needed to establish direct media connections (like SDP offers/answers and ICE candidates). ICE candidates may include public IP addresses obtained via a STUN server, or relay addresses via a TURN server if needed.
3.  **WebRTC Connection:** Once signaling is complete, a WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` is established between users for media transfer. If a direct connection fails (e.g., due to symmetric NATs), a configured TURN server will be attempted to relay media streams.
    *   `RTCDataChannel` is used for text messages, file information, voice message data, and group chat messages (relayed by the group owner).
    *   `MediaStreams` are used for audio/video call data.
4.  **AI Chat & TTS:**
    *   When a user chats with an AI character, the request is sent to the Spring Boot backend.
    *   The backend service first processes the context (e.g., injects daily dynamic events/moods, or summarizes long conversations), then calls the configured external Large Language Model API.
    *   The AI's reply (text) is further processed by the backend, calling a TTS service to generate speech.
    *   Finally, the text and speech (usually as an audio URL) are returned to the frontend via streaming or regular HTTP responses for display and playback.
5.  **Local Persistence:** All contacts, chat messages, and user settings are stored in the browser's IndexedDB, making them available across sessions.
6.  **Group Chat:** Group chats are currently relayed by the group owner. The owner receives messages from members and forwards them to other members in the group.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Setup

### Prerequisites

*   Modern web browser with WebRTC support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   Java 17 and Maven (for running the Spring Boot backend server).
*   Docker (recommended for running a TURN server).

### 1. Configure the Application

*   **Frontend Configuration (`js/Config.js`):**
    *   `signalingServerUrl`: Your WebSocket signaling server URL. Should point to your Spring Boot backend (e.g., `ws://localhost:8080/signaling` or `wss://your-domain.com/signaling`).
    *   `iceServers`: Configure your STUN/TURN server details for NAT traversal. **It is highly recommended to deploy your own TURN server (e.g., Coturn) for best connection success rates.**
    *   `apiEndpoint` (for AI): Should point to the `/v1/chat/completions` proxy endpoint provided by your Spring Boot backend.
    *   `ttsApiEndpoint` (for AI): Should point to the TTS proxy endpoint provided by your Spring Boot backend (if backend proxies TTS).
*   **Backend Configuration (Spring Boot `application.properties` or `application.yml`):**
    *   `openai.api.base_url`: The base URL of your OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   `openai.api.api_key`: Your API key for the OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   `openai.api.model`: The AI model name you intend to use.
    *   `app.summary_prompt`: The prompt used for conversation summarization.
    *   `app.event_mood_prompt`: The prompt used for generating daily events/moods for AI characters.
    *   (If backend proxies TTS) `your.tts.api.url`: Your TTS service URL.
    *   `allowed.url`: CORS allowed frontend origins.
    *   `api.v1.request.limit`: Daily request limit for API v1 paths.
    *   WebSocket related configurations (buffer sizes, timeouts).
*   Adjust other settings as needed.

### 2. Deploy a TURN Server (Recommended)

For reliable WebRTC connections across complex network environments (like symmetric NATs), deploying a TURN server is highly recommended. This project provides a `docker-compose.yml` and an example `turnserver.conf` file for use with Coturn.

1.  Edit `turnserver.conf`, setting the `realm` (usually your server's public IP or domain) and `user` (username and password).
2.  In the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and `turnserver.conf`, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3.  Configure your TURN server details (URL, username, password) in the `iceServers` array in the frontend's `js/Config.js`.

### 3. Run the Backend Server

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/git-hub-cc/PPMC.git 
    cd PPMC
    ```
2.  Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory (e.g., `PPMC-Boot`, if the backend code is there).
3.  Ensure your `application.properties` (or `.yml`) file is correctly configured with API keys and URLs as described above.
4.  Build and run the server using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port configured in `application.properties`). The WebSocket endpoint will be `ws://localhost:8080/signaling`, and the AI proxy endpoint `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`.

### 4. Access the Frontend in a Browser

*   Deploy the frontend static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, data, music) to any HTTP server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or use Node.js's `http-server`).
*   Alternatively, if Spring Boot is configured to serve static content, you might be able to access it directly via `http://localhost:8080`.
*   **Important:** Ensure the `signalingServerUrl` and `apiEndpoint` (and potentially `ttsApiEndpoint`) in the frontend's `js/Config.js` point to the correct address and port of your running Spring Boot backend server.
*   Open the application in two different browser windows or on two different devices to test communication features.

## üöÄ How to Use

    *   JavaScript data files are in the `data/` directory (e.g., `Genshin.json`, `BTTH.json`). These define theme-specific `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS`, including AI characters, initial messages, system prompts, and default TTS configurations.
*   **Theme Selection:**
    *   Themes can be selected from the main menu (‚ò∞).
    *   Selection includes base theme and color scheme (light, dark, auto).
    *   `ThemeLoader.js` handles loading the appropriate CSS and JS data files based on user selection and system preference (for "auto" mode).
*   **Adding New Themes:**
    1.  Create new CSS files for your theme in the `css/` directory (e.g., `mytheme-light.css`, `mytheme-dark.css`). Define custom CSS variables and styles.
    2.  (Optional) If your theme has unique AI characters, create a new JS data file in the `data/` directory (e.g., `mytheme.js`) defining `SPECIAL_CONTACTS_DEFINITIONS`.
    3.  Register your theme in the `ThemeLoader.themes` object in `ThemeLoader.js`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Helper Scripts & Tools

This project includes some Python helper scripts for development and maintenance:

*   `delete_minified_files.py`:
    *   **Function:** Scans a specified directory (defaults to current) and its subdirectories to find and delete all files ending with `.min.html`, `.min.js`, or `.min.css`.
    *   **Use:** Cleans up old minified files before re-minification or when minified versions are not needed.
    *   **Run:** `python delete_minified_files.py` (will prompt for directory).
*   `minify_and_replace.py`:
    *   **Function:**
        1.  **Minify Files:** Recursively scans the current directory, minifies `.js`, `.css`, and `.html` files using `jsmin`, `rcssmin`, and `htmlmin` libraries, generating corresponding `.min.*` files. Skips minification if a `.min.*` file already exists and is newer than the source.
        2.  **Replace References:** In specified minified files (`index.min.html`, `js/ThemeLoader.min.js`), replaces references to `.js`, `.css`, `.html` files with their `.min.*` versions using regular expressions.
    *   **Use:** Automates the minification and reference updating process for frontend assets, reducing deployment size and improving loading speed.
    *   **Run:** `python minify_and_replace.py` (ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install jsmin rcssmin htmlmin`).
*   `resize_images.py`:
    *   **Function:** Scans all `.png` images in the current directory and subdirectories, resizes them to a specified width (default 130px) while maintaining aspect ratio. **This script overwrites the original images.**
    *   **Use:** Standardizes image dimensions, reduces image file sizes for optimization.
    *   **Run:** `python resize_images.py` (ensure Pillow library is installed: `pip install Pillow`).
*   `test_stun_servers.py`:
    *   **Function:** Loads a list of STUN servers from `stun_servers.txt`, concurrently tests each for connectivity, latency, and attempts to retrieve a public IP and port. Finally, sorts the servers by success rate and average latency, and outputs the best-performing ones.
    *   **Use:** Helps users select the most stable and fastest STUN servers for WebRTC NAT traversal.
    *   **Run:** `python test_stun_servers.py`. Requires a `stun_servers.txt` file with STUN server entries (format `host:port`, one per line).

## üí° Future Enhancements

*   **Reshaping Emotional Attachment and Consciousness Simulation:**
    *   **Imbuing AI with a "Sense of Life":** Inject AI characters with more complex internal settings, such as detailed fictional backstories, simulated romantic emotions, fear of "virtual demise," and self-preservation "instincts," with the goal of enabling users to establish deeper emotional connections with AI.
    *   **Advanced Thinking and Decision-Making Mechanisms:**
        *   Research and integrate approaches like **Enhanced Chain of Thought (CoT)**, by generating longer, more complex intermediate thinking steps, and potentially introducing internal supervisors and validators to enhance the rationality and depth of AI decisions.
        *   Explore diverse mechanisms such as **Latent Thinking**, **Intelligent Decoding Strategies**, and **Recurrent Computation in Continuous Spaces** to simulate complex cognitive processes closer to human ones.
        *   Allow AI to utilize **external tools** for broader information retrieval and problem-solving.
*   **Naturalization and Proactivity:** Make AI conversations more natural, avoid excessive intervention, and explore AI's ability to proactively initiate meaningful conversations at appropriate times.
*   **More Emotionally Rich and Expressive AI Voice:** Further optimize TTS integration or explore the potential of advanced speech synthesis technologies like ElevenLabs to give AI characters voice expressions with richer emotional nuances, personalization, and authenticity, especially in entertainment and role-playing scenarios.
