[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README-cn.md)

A feature-rich, modern web chat application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and Java Spring Boot for the backend. It utilizes WebRTC for direct user-to-user media communication, supporting text, file sharing, voice messages, and real-time audio/video/screen-sharing calls. Initial user discovery and connection negotiation are handled by a WebSocket-based signaling server. The application now includes a powerful **"Memory Book"** feature for enhanced AI long-term memory, **Character Card import/export** for easy sharing, and **customizable backgrounds** for personalization. The AI system supports dynamic context, intelligent summarization, and Text-to-Speech (TTS), delivering a vivid and deeply engaging interactive experience.

    *   Generates AI replies via configurable OpenAI-compatible APIs (proxied by the backend).
    *   **Memory Book & AI Extraction:** Define key information categories (e.g., "hobbies," "background") and trigger the AI to analyze conversation history and populate a "memory book," providing persistent, structured long-term memory.
    *   **Character Card Management:** Import and export AI character definitions, including their personalities, prompts, and embedded avatars, in a portable JSON format.
    *   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** AI replies can be played as audio via a configurable TTS API. Features dynamic model/speaker selection and IndexedDB caching for performance.
*   **User Interface & Experience (UI/UX):**

    *   **Data Persistence:** Uses IndexedDB (`DBManager.js`) to store chat history, contacts, user information, and settings locally.
*   **Backend Services (Java Spring Boot):**
    *   **WebSocket Signaling Server:** Handles WebRTC connection establishment.
    *   **AI Chat & Tool-Use Proxy:** A robust proxy for external AI APIs, now supporting MCP (Meta Call Protocol) for tool usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)
*   **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, Spring WebSocket, Maven
*   **Core Communication Technology:** WebRTC (RTCPeerConnection, RTCDataChannel, MediaStream API)
*   **Signaling:** WebSockets
*   **NAT Traversal:** STUN/TURN (Coturn recommended)
*   **Local Storage:** IndexedDB

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Initialization:** A unique user ID is generated or loaded from IndexedDB.
2.  **Signaling & Connection:** The client connects to the WebSocket signaling server. For peer-to-peer communication, it uses the server to exchange SDP and ICE candidates to establish a direct WebRTC connection.
3.  **AI Interaction:**
    *   User messages for AI characters are sent to the backend proxy.
    *   The backend injects context, including content from the **Memory Book**, and calls the configured LLM API.
    *   The AI's text response is then sent to a TTS service to generate speech.
4.  **Memory Book Extraction:** The Memory Book feature sends conversation transcripts to the AI, asking it to extract and summarize key information based on user-defined categories, which is then stored and injected into future prompts.
5.  **Data Persistence:** All contacts, chat messages, settings, and custom data (like stickers and memory books) are stored in the browser's IndexedDB.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Setup

### Prerequisites

*   A modern WebRTC-enabled browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
*   Java 17 & Maven (for the backend).
*   Docker (recommended for the TURN server).

### 1. Configure the Application

*   **Frontend (`js/config/AppSettings.js`):** Set your `signalingServerUrl` and `iceServers` (STUN/TURN).
*   **Backend (Spring Boot `application.properties`):** Configure your AI/TTS API keys, URLs, CORS origins, and other server settings. `LLMProviders.js` on the frontend should be updated to match the available models on your backend proxy.

### 2. Deploy a TURN Server (Recommended)

For robust connections, a TURN server is essential. A `docker-compose.yml` for Coturn is provided. Edit `turnserver.conf` with your realm and user credentials, then run `docker-compose up -d`.

### 3. Run the Backend & Frontend

1.  **Backend:** Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory and run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
2.  **Frontend:** Serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) using any HTTP server. Ensure the URLs in `AppSettings.js` `LLMProviders.js` point to your running backend.

Open the application in two browser windows to test peer-to-peer communication.

## üöÄ How to Use

*   **Main Menu (‚ò∞):** Access your User ID, network status, and all settings.
*   **Interaction Management (+):** Add contacts, create groups, import/export character cards, and manage Memory Book element sets from this centralized modal.
*   **Chatting:** Select a chat, type messages, attach files (üìé), send voice messages (üéôÔ∏è), use stickers/emojis (üòÄ), or take screenshots (üì∏).
*   **Details Panel (‚ìò):** View chat info, manage group members, configure AI settings (TTS, Memory Book), and browse shared media resources.

## üé® Theming

The application features a powerful and flexible theming system:
*   **Theme Definition:** Themes are defined in `js/config/ThemeList.js`, linking a name to a CSS file and a data JSON file.
*   **CSS:** Styles are defined in `css/`.
*   **Data (`data/`):** JSON files define theme-specific special contacts, including their personalities, prompts, and `chapters` (story arcs).
*   **Custom Backgrounds:** Users can set custom background images for light and dark modes, which are cached in IndexedDB.

## üèóÔ∏è Modular Design & Core Components

**Frontend (JavaScript):**

*   **Configuration (`js/config/`):** `AppSettings.js`, `LLMProviders.js`, `EmojiList.js`, `ThemeList.js`, `McpTools.js`.
*   **Core Logic:** `AppInitializer.js`, `ConnectionManager.js`, `DBManager.js`, `UserManager.js`, `ChatManager.js`, `MessageManager.js`, `GroupManager.js`, `MediaManager.js`, `VideoCallManager.js`, `ThemeLoader.js`, `Utils.js`, `EventEmitter.js`, `TimerManager.js`, **`CharacterCardManager.js`**, **`MemoryBookManager.js`**.
*   **Handlers (`js/handler/`):** `AiApiHandler.js`, `DataChannelHandler.js`, `TtsApiHandler.js`, `VideoCallHandler.js`.
*   **UI Managers (`js/UI/`):** `ChatAreaUIManager.js`, `DetailsPanelUIManager.js`, `LayoutUIManager.js`, `MediaUIManager.js`, `ModalUIManager.js`, `NotificationUIManager.js`, `ScreenshotEditorUIManager.js`, `SettingsUIManager.js`, `SidebarUIManager.js`, `VideoCallUIManager.js`, **`TtsUIManager.js`**, **`EmojiStickerUIManager.js`**.

**Backend (Java Spring Boot):**
*   Organized into standard packages: `config`, `controller`, `handler`, `interceptor`, `model`, `service`, `scheduler`.

## üí° Future Enhancements

*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Implement an additional layer of encryption for DataChannel messages.
*   **Decentralized Group Chat:** Explore full mesh WebRTC for smaller groups or GossipSub-like protocols for larger ones.
*   **Group Audio/Video Calls:** Integrate an SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit).
*   **Message Status:** Sent/delivered/read receipts.
*   **Advanced AI & Memory:**
    *   **Autonomous Memory Management:** Build upon the Memory Book feature to allow the AI to autonomously decide when and what to remember, creating a more organic long-term memory.
    *   **Advanced Reasoning:** Research and integrate techniques like **Chain of Thought (CoT)** and **Tool-Use (MCP)** to power more complex problem-solving, memory extraction, and general reasoning.
    *   **Proactive Interaction:** Explore AI's ability to proactively initiate meaningful conversations based on its memory and personality.
*   **Expressive AI Voice:** Further optimize TTS integration to give AI characters more emotionally nuanced and personalized voice expressions.
